            <p class="lead">The artesinal art of creating perfumes from essential oils, resins and attars is an ancient tradition that has deep connections to various pagan belief systems.
            Plants are believed to have vibrational energies, each plant being used for a different emotional, spiritual or physical healing. Used to support well being as well as for the property of scent, these oils have been created in the sacred ways of the Ancients, with learnings coming from Celtic, Vodoun and Maori belief systems.
            Each oil is batch blended in small amounts at various phases of the moon, using organic (where available)essential oils and attars, mixed in to organic carrier oils. <br>Created to ensure the "life force" energy of the plants are captured and respected these sacred oils are created in sacred space with a deep reverence for the plants and their energies.
            They are sold worldwide via the internet and in 
            various clinics around Aotearoa.
